## Overview

I am very interested in the game development space and thought this project would be a great opportunity to dip my toe in. I used Unity Engine which integrates C# code.

## [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)

At first just looking at C# seemed pretty daunting but once I got started it very quickly became pretty intuitive. I have enjoyed my time with it and look forward to learning more by building my games and other projects.

## [Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html)

Unity is fantastic! After a few hours of walkthrough videos it's pretty easy to get the hang of adding and manipulating objects exactly how you want. Using C# along with Unity makes things pretty straight forward.
